# RTSGameEngine

Leight, high-performance game engine for RTS and/or building simulators (cause they're somehow similar, up to some distinct).
The main goal of this project is to create the engine able to run wighteous simulations on weak stuffed computers.

The engine uses ready solutions for graphics (OpenGL), music (OpenAL), input handling (GLFW).
